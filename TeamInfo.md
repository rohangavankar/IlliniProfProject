**Project Summary**
--------------
Our project introduces a user-friendly application that streamlines the professor selection process. Leveraging data from Rate My Professors and Wades GPA Visualization dataset, our backend employs complex SQL queries to process information, calculate average GPAs, and ensure up-to-date details. The frontend offers an intuitive interface with features like hyperlinks to professor bios, top 5 recent comments, user-generated tags, ratings, and a "Would take again" status. In short, our full-stack web application simplifies the task of choosing professors, enhancing the overall academic journey for students.
