**Project Summary**
--------------
Our project aims to streamline the process of selecting professors for classes through an efficient and user-friendly application. Leveraging data from Rate My Professors and Wades GPA Visualization dataset, our application provides users with a robust set of filter options, allowing them to narrow down choices based on department, course number, and more. The backend seamlessly integrates and processes this diverse data through complex SQL queries, calculating average GPAs, and ensuring up-to-date information. The frontend delivers an intuitive interface with hyperlinks to professor bios and the ability to view the top 5 most recent comments. Additional features, such as user-generated tags, ratings, and a "Would take again" status, contribute to a comprehensive professor selection experience. We also implement the ability to add comments to a professor's profile along with grades received in the class and professor ratings. With a minimalist design and powerful functionality, our application simplifies the often daunting task of choosing professors, enhancing the overall academic journey for students.
